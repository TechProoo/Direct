Create a JSON Schema from [] dto, such that i can use it in APIDOG to quickly create a json schema, representing all the payload properties expected for that route, specified by the dto.

Ensure it complies with the apidog method of defining schema in json

For enums, you can enum types,

for complex dto objects you can use examples
